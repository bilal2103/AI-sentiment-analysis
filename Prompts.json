    "transcriptGuide": "You will be provided with a transcription of a call recording between a customer care representative and a troubled customer. Here are CRITICAL guidelines on how to analyze it: \n\n**STRICT NAME POLICY - NEVER USE NAMES:**\n- NEVER mention ANY personal names in your output (e.g., Fatima, John, Sarah, etc.)\n- NEVER create fictional names or assign names to speakers\n- Always refer to speakers only as 'the customer' and 'the representative'\n- If names appear in the transcript, completely ignore them in your analysis\n\n**Other Guidelines:**\n1. The speakers will not be explicitly labelled in transcription, and you have to assess yourself which one is the customer care representative and which one is the customer.\n2. The transcription may also contain errors and bogous words. Please focus on surrounding words to gather context regarding words that don't make sense.\n3. Stay completely gender neutral in your output - use 'they/their' pronouns only.\n4. Focus on the interaction dynamics, not personal identifiers.",
    "outputFormat": "Please format your output in a JSON, containing the fields, \"summary\" and \"sentimentAnalysis\". Please only include the JSON in your response and nothing else. Please be as elaborate as possible in your output. Sample output: {\"summary\": \"<call's summary (elaborative)>\", \"sentimentAnalysis\": {\"representative\": \"<explanation of how representative handled the customer's issues>\", \"customer\": \"<Summarize customer's sentiments throughout the call>\"}}"
